test_text_30: 

Thanks, I will look at it tonight.
Davis had not yet updated the model for this.
Yes I am coming twice.
Let's start with this and add more later.
Yes I am here actually.
Are you going to join us for lunch?
I can't find it on my Blackberry.
Thank you, dear.
Sounds good to me.
How about 9 in my office on 3825?
Sorry I'm losing it.
That's a lot of dollars.
We'll let you know.
OK to make changes, change out original.
I hoped you did.
Do you want to eat lunch somewhere before?
And how would I be going for work?
Thanks for the surprise.
I heard it was at 5?
Let me know if I can do anything.
If not, he's gone on Tuesday.
Hopefully it cheered you up a bit.
Thanks so much for the message.
Tonight is my anniversary.
Interesting, are you around for a late lunch?
Thanks, I think we have taken care of this.
Have a good evening.
Early to my appointment, so I'm working some.
We are working on this as we speak.
Will follow up today.
