Here is the message.
We don't want to look bad to Dyn.
Yes, I will do so.
Call me at 832.865.2445.
Talk to you soon.
Lynn, got to the office OK.
It may be an hour.
Jim please confirm to Vince you are happy.
If he'll sign no issues with Barclays.
We're on the way.
Or are you going to be tied up with dinner?
Hope your week is going well.
Is this the only time available?
We just pulled schedules from the web.
I can call Jan at home so I can get access.
I am going to be available in a few minutes.
Did you get the message to call Mary Kay?
Even Michael was impressed.
No there will be plenty of others.
I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
What is the purpose of this?
First objective is to keep electricity flowing.
I will try to reach you on Wednesday.
What do you think about that sir?
Nice weather for it.
I think those are the right dates.
But I hope to see you at Kari's house.
Do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch?
Does Friday at 10 work for you?
This message is about new building tour.
I can be there within the hour.
Do you want to fax it to my hotel?
Would you like to take Cam?
I meant to try and explain, not to redo.
Cool is it not.
Is Derrick OK with it?
So I'll see you at the airport?
Did you differ from me?
Hang in there guys.
Just in case we haven't invited any of them.
Didn't get a commitment.
Are you sure I don't need to be there?
Go ahead and notify.
It should be Cynthia Barow instead.
I doubt that it is forecasted.
If I hear anything I will let you know.
See, it's cold enough for hot chocolate!
I am getting lots of questions.
So the language does have value.
I'll email later tonight.
How did they get onto our floor?
All the kids were cute.
I agree with Morris.
I will take a look at this today.
Great job, Kevin.
I'm waiting for my close up.
Will you come get me?
